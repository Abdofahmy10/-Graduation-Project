Speculation in Westminster suggests pulling back cuts of more than Â£1,000 a year to some families' incomes to Â£300 or Â£400.\\nThe actual details are being kept tightly under wraps.\\nBut be in no doubt, the decisions the chancellor has made in recent weeks will be felt around the country.\\nHe faces an economic test of trying to stick to his own rules on spending - not just getting the books back into balance but into surplus by the end of the Parliament.\\nIt is a political test too.\\nMinisters have consistently expressed their desire to make the Conservatives the party of the centre ground, standing up for the so-called \"strivers\", making their party the natural home for the mythical swing voters of Middle England.\\nBut the pressure is on to make a programme of cuts meet that goal.\\nThe Spending Review is a hefty challenge for the new Opposition too.\\nLabour has an opportunity to show they are capable not just of agreeing positions among themselves in order to make an articulate case, but also that they are up to the job of providing proper scrutiny of the government's biggest decisions.\\nAfter a very shaky few weeks for Jeremy Corbyn's Labour, it is not certain they'll be able to do that.\\nLabour, the SNP and the Lib Dems face a government fresh from an election victory that believes - especially on the economy - that it has a mandate to act.</td>\n",
